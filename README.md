1. I made a wonderful project work where I can show the world sports league by using SportsDB API. I used  React as a library for making my project lucrative. 
2. This is the first time React project where I used React Router. By fetch the API, I got more than 500 soprts league detail information. I made a button where after clicking that I wanted to show the specific League's history and I made it successfully. 
3. I also used conditional rendaring where I have shown the female or male image depending on League's Gender.  
4. I used React-bootstrap and plain CSS for viewing my page gorgeous. 
5. I made responsive as well where in mobile device shows one single league and in tabets shows double.  Now I am going to make my site live by using NETLIFY.....
